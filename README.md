# Bayesian Optimization

TO DO List:
*  Write the code for the original Bayesian Optimization Algorithm  (done)
*  Write the code for the iterative B.O. with hard bounds (done)
*  Extend the algorithm to discrete optimization
*  Write tests (in progress)
*  Get the algorithm to work using L-BFGS-B instead of L-BFGS (in progress)
*  Write the code for the iterative B.O. with soft bounds (in progress)
*  How to choose the power in IBOhardBounds? (in progress)
*  Make sure IBOhardbounds and IBOsoftbounds extend a common Model
*  Write a AcquisitionFunction class and replace Bayesopt by Bayesopt[AcquisitionFunction]
*  Remove check_within_bounds from....


Issues:
* Infinite loop sometimes?
* IBOhardBounds structure is not clear yet
* LSH / Fonction de Hachage

* NMI : normalized m        information / Smile scala
* Regularization
